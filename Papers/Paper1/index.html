										<p>
											Using our class discussions as a springboard, you will now return to the readings from this class to carefully consider a question and to craft an essay based one one of the <a href = "#topics">essay topics below</a>.  This essay will provide a creative outlet to find your own voice and to express critical thinking skills built around the varied works we've been reading in class.  You will also practice the art of argumentation by precisely stating a stance and defending it with evidence in a clear, easy-to-follow manner.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Timeline</h3>
										<p>
											Coming soon...
										</p>

										<h3>Audience</h3>
										<p>
											Ursinus College's academic/intellectual community, including your fellow students, instructors, mentors, etc.  You'll want to strike a balance between being thought provoking and exacting, but also accessible to people outside of our class but in our community who may not have read the works you're citing.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Format
										</h3>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Approximately 1200-1500 words.  You may format your paper any way you want with whatever spacing you want (I personally use <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> to craft PDF documents in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, though most people probably prefer Microsoft Word).  But regardless, in addition to the text, you should include
												<ul>
													<li>Your name</li>
													<li>The title of the paper (you do not need a title page)</li>
													<li>The date</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Writing Goals</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Taking a stance with a clear thesis statement and well-organized, easy-to-follow text
											</li>
											<li>
												Lively, distinctive, original voice
											</li>
											<li>
												Appropriate and frequent references to text, including passages we haven't explicitly discussed in class
											</li>
											<li>
												Thoughtful, provocative, creative, nuanced interpretations of your textual references
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>About Starting Your Paper (by <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/5902-leslie-new">Leslie New</a>)</h3>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Reread the text/s you are going to be examining. Read carefully, and take fresh notes that relate to your topic. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Examine your notes. Think about what the evidence seems to be telling you. Take further notes on any thoughts you have about the evidence. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Using the evidence as your guide, compose a basic thesis statement. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Organize your notes into an outline. See above for suggestions.
											</li>
											<li>
												Examine your outline. Think about whether you have put the evidence in the order that makes the most sense. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Based on your outline, transform your basic thesis statement into a full thesis statement. Make sure the organization of your thesis corresponds to the order of your paper. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Now you can start to write. 
											</li>
										</ol>
									


										<h3>Other Tips</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Analysis</b> and <b>interpretation</b> should be two of your main goals here.  You should strive to translate what a particular author is saying into your own words in a clear manner and in a way that supports your message.  Explore the logical implications of the authors' statements, as well as any ambiguity, hidden assumptions, unexpected consequences, or connections to other texts.
											</li>
											<li>
												You may need to re-read some of the sources you're using many times.  This is completely normal!  Just make sure you leave yourself time to do it properly
											</li>
											<li>
												Be sure to introduce quotations in a way that flows.  For instance, "according to Adichie, "[quotation]"" (page #), as opposed to just plopping a sentence in the middle of text without a clear attribution.  You may also want to orient that quote in the context of the larger work, such as "after Douglass escaped slavery and got to know other active abolitionists, he honed is perspective on Christianity in America, saying ["quotation"]"
											</li>
											
										</ul>

										<h3>Evaluation</h3>
										<p>
											We'll be splitting the paper grade into several categories, where you'll be graded on a 10 point scale on each category.  Point assignments can be interpreted as follows
										</p>
										<table>
										<tr>
											<td>9-10</td>
											<td>Exemplary; exceeds the goal; a model example for future students</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>8</td>
											<td>Very good; met the goal fully</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>7</td>
											<td>Met the goal minimally</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>6</td>
											<td>Just barely acceptable, but fell short of the mark and needs improvement</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>0-5</td>
											<td>Unsatisfactory; does not meet goal</td>
										</tr>
										</table>

										<p>
											Below are the categories to which points are assigned
										</p>

										<table>
											<tr>
												<td><h4>Category</h4></td>
												<td><h4>Goal</h4></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Main Idea / Thesis Statement</td>
												<td>
													The main idea is clear, concise, debatable, specific, and interesting, and is expressed via a precise thesis statement.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Creativity / Making It Your Own</td>
												<td>
													Takes a unique, creative approach with a lively, original voice
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Textual references</td>
												<td>
													Carefully chosen, frequent, detailed, skillfully integrated references to the texts. Selects several passages that were not discussed in class.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Interpretation of Texts</td>
												<td>Student shows interpretations of the text that are creative, nuanced, thought provoking, and/or just plain provocative.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Organization</td>
												<td>Each paragraph has clear topic sentences, the document flows from idea to idea and paragraph to paragraph, and the reader avoids "getting lost"</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sentence Level</td>
												<td>Sentences should be clear, with varied diction, and edited/polished without grammar and spelling mistakes.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Revisions</td>
												<td>
													There is evidence that the student made an earnest, good faith attempt to address comments from me and/or the writing fellow in their final revision.
												</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<h2><a name = "topics">Essay Topics (Choose One!)</a></h2>
										<p>
											Below are some essay topics you can choose.
										</p>

										<h3>Gender Caves (topic proposed by <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/5902-leslie-new">Leslie New</a>)</h3>
										
										<p>
											Adichie contends that gender is merely a social construct, and she offers 15 suggestions to overcome this construct. A reading of Plato's "Allegory" might lead us to conclude that Adichie is helping take us out of the cave in order to see the "truth" about gender. If this is so, then what exactly is the truth about gender, according to Adichie? In other words, if we are held back by social norms about what gender is, then what would leaving the cave mean in terms of our understanding of gender, according to Adichie?
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Our task</b>: Consider the above questions by doing the following: 
											<ol>
												<li>
													Describe Adichie's argument that gender is taught by society, by engaging closely with a few key points of her analysis
												</li>
												<li>
													Explain how in Plato's terms this represents a cave, introducing a reader to his depiction of life in and out of the cave
												</li>
												<li>
													Explain what Adichie would say leaving the cave means when it comes to seeing the truth about gender.
												</li>
											</ol>
										</p>

										
										<p>
											<b>NOTE:</b> This prompt is not intended to force us to agree with Adichie, but rather to decompose her arguments and put them in the context of Plato's "Allegory." If we disagree with the concept of the gender cave, we can take that approach, but we must make our case by drawing upon Adichie and "Allegory.""
