									</header>

									<div id="page-content">
										
										<p>
											The purpose of this assignment is to help you continue to hone your skills of arguing points in writing, and to provide a creative outlet for understanding your own self in the process of developing your arguments.  You will do this via one of the <a href = "#topics">essay topics below</a>.  Like the last essay, this essay will provide a creative outlet to find your own voice and to express critical thinking skills built around the varied works we've been reading in class.  You will also practice the art of argumentation by precisely stating a stance and <b>defending it with evidence</b> in a clear, easy-to-follow manner.
										</p>

										
										<h3>Timeline</h3>
										<p>
											Coming soon...
										</p>

										<h3>Audience</h3>
										<p>
											Ursinus College's academic/intellectual community, including your fellow students, instructors, mentors, etc.  You'll want to strike a balance between being thought provoking and exacting, but also accessible to people outside of our class but in our community who may not have read the works you're citing.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Format
										</h3>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Approximately 1200-1500 words.  You may format your paper any way you want with whatever spacing you want (I personally use <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> to craft PDF documents in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, though most people probably prefer Microsoft Word).  But regardless, in addition to the text, you should include
												<ul>
													<li>Your name</li>
													<li>The title of the paper (you do not need a title page)</li>
													<li>The date</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Writing Goals</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Taking a stance with a clear thesis statement and well-organized, easy-to-follow text
											</li>
											<li>
												Lively, distinctive, original voice
											</li>
											<li>
												Appropriate and frequent references to text, including passages we haven't explicitly discussed in class, and perhaps new passages that you find on your own
											</li>
											<li>
												Thoughtful, provocative, creative, nuanced interpretations of your textual references
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Other Tips</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Analysis</b> and <b>interpretation</b> should be two of your main goals here.  You should strive to translate what a particular author is saying into your own words in a clear manner and in a way that supports your message.  Explore the logical implications of the authors' statements, as well as any ambiguity, hidden assumptions, unexpected consequences, or connections to other texts.
											</li>
											<li>
												You may need to re-read some of the sources you're using many times.  This is completely normal!  Just make sure you leave yourself time to do it properly
											</li>
											<li>
												Be sure to introduce quotations in a way that flows.  For instance, "according to Mills, "[quotation]"" (page #), as opposed to just plopping a sentence in the middle of text without a clear attribution.  You may also want to orient that quote in the context of the larger work, such as "after Douglass escaped slavery and got to know other active abolitionists, he honed is perspective on Christianity in America, saying ["quotation"]". <b>Be sure your quotes are relevant to the larger point you're making, and that they are characteristic of the work you are citing!</b>
											</li>
											
										</ul>

										<h3>Evaluation</h3>
										<p>
											We'll be splitting the paper grade into several categories, where you'll be graded on a 10 point scale on each category.  Point assignments can be interpreted as follows
										</p>
										<table>
										<tr>
											<td>9-10</td>
											<td>Exemplary; exceeds the goal; a model example for future students</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>8</td>
											<td>Very good; met the goal fully</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>7</td>
											<td>Met the goal minimally</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>6</td>
											<td>Just barely acceptable, but fell short of the mark and needs improvement</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>0-5</td>
											<td>Unsatisfactory; does not meet goal</td>
										</tr>
										</table>

										<p>
											Below are the categories to which points are assigned
										</p>

										<table>
											<tr>
												<td><h4>Category</h4></td>
												<td><h4>Goal</h4></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Main Idea / Thesis Statement</td>
												<td>
													The main idea is clear, concise, debatable, specific, and interesting, and is expressed via a precise thesis statement.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Creativity / Making It Your Own</td>
												<td>
													Takes a unique, creative approach with a lively, original voice
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Textual references</td>
												<td>
													Carefully chosen, frequent, detailed, skillfully integrated references to the texts. Selects several passages that were not discussed in class.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Interpretation of Texts</td>
												<td>Student shows interpretations of the text that are creative, nuanced, thought provoking, and/or just plain provocative.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Organization</td>
												<td>Each paragraph has clear topic sentences, the document flows from idea to idea and paragraph to paragraph, and the reader avoids "getting lost"</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sentence Level</td>
												<td>Sentences should be clear, with varied diction, and edited/polished without grammar and spelling mistakes.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Revisions</td>
												<td>
													There is evidence that the student made an earnest, good faith attempt to address comments from me and/or the writing fellow in their final revision.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Bonus Points (+0.5)</td><td>Includes an informative and entertaining title</td>
											</tr>
										</table>
