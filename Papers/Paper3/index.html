										<p>
											This is the final essay for the class!  Like the papers preceding it, the purpose is to help you continue to hone your skills of arguing points in writing by precisely stating a stance and <b>defending it with evidence</b> in a clear, easy-to-follow manner.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Timeline</h3>
										<table>
											<tr><td>Friday 11/29</td><td>Brainstorming Due</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Friday 12/6</td><td>First draft due</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Monday 12/9, Tuesday 12/10</td><td>Paper Meetings</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Friday 12/13</td><td>Final Draft Due</td></tr>
										</table>
										
										<h3>Audience</h3>
										<p>
											Ursinus College's academic/intellectual community, including your fellow students, instructors, mentors, etc.  You'll want to strike a balance between being thought provoking and exacting, but also accessible to people outside of our class but in our community who may not have read the works you're citing.
										</p>
										
										<h3>
											Format
										</h3>
										
										<ul>
											<li>
												Approximately 1500-1800 words.  You may format your paper any way you want with whatever spacing you want (I personally use <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> to craft PDF documents in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, though most people probably prefer Microsoft Word).  But regardless, in addition to the text, you should include
												<ul>
													<li>Your name</li>
													<li>The title of the paper (you do not need a title page)</li>
													<li>The date</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h3>Writing Goals</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Taking a stance with a clear thesis statement and well-organized, easy-to-follow text
											</li>
											<li>
												Lively, distinctive, original voice
											</li>
											<li>
												Appropriate and frequent references to text, including passages we haven't explicitly discussed in class, and perhaps new passages that you find on your own
											</li>
											<li>
												Thoughtful, provocative, creative, nuanced interpretations of your textual references
											</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h3>Evaluation</h3>
										<p>
											We'll be splitting the paper grade into several categories, where you'll be graded on a 10 point scale on each category.  Point assignments can be interpreted as follows
										</p>
										<table>
										<tr>
											<td>9-10</td>
											<td>Exemplary; exceeds the goal; a model example for future students</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>8</td>
											<td>Very good; met the goal fully</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>7</td>
											<td>Met the goal minimally</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>6</td>
											<td>Just barely acceptable, but fell short of the mark and needs improvement</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>0-5</td>
											<td>Unsatisfactory; does not meet goal</td>
										</tr>
										</table>
										
										<p>
											Below are the categories to which points are assigned
										</p>
										
										<table>
											<tr>
												<td><h4>Category</h4></td>
												<td><h4>Goal</h4></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Main Idea / Thesis Statement</td>
												<td>
													The main idea is clear, concise, debatable, specific, and interesting, and is expressed via a precise thesis statement.  <b>Thesis statement connects to the prompt</b>
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Creativity / Making It Your Own</td>
												<td>
													Takes a unique, creative approach with a lively, original voice
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Textual references</td>
												<td>
													Carefully chosen, frequent, detailed, skillfully integrated references to the texts. Selects several passages that were not discussed in class.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Interpretation of Texts</td>
												<td>Student shows interpretations of the text that are creative, nuanced, thought provoking, and/or just plain provocative.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Organization</td>
												<td>Each paragraph has clear topic sentences, the document flows from idea to idea and paragraph to paragraph, and the reader avoids "getting lost"</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sentence Level</td>
												<td>Sentences should be clear, with varied diction, and edited/polished without grammar and spelling mistakes.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Revisions</td>
												<td>
													There is evidence that the student made an earnest, good faith attempt to address comments from me and/or the writing fellow in their final revision.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Bonus Points (+0.5)</td><td>Includes an informative and entertaining title</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<h2><a name = "topics">Essay Topics (Choose One!)</a></h2>


										<h3><a name = "ai">CIE Authors + Generative AI</a></h3>
										<p>
											Pick one of the texts that we've looked at recently, and imagine what the author would have to say about "generative AI," such as (but not limited to) ChatGPT, image synthesis systems like <a href = "https://www.midjourney.com/home">Midjourney</a>, or generative music systems like <a href = "https://suno.com/">Suno</a>.  <span style="color:blue">Would the author have an exclusively positive view on it or a negative view on it, or would they have a more nuanced position?  Articulate specifically in light of the values communicated in the text, and use quotes/paraphrasing to support your position.</span>  To spice things up, you may even consider writing in the style of the author when arguing your points, imagining it as a 2024 appendix to their work.
										</p>


										<h3><a name = "freedom">The Price of "Freedom"</a></h3>
										<p>
											One of the last sentences in <i>Persepolis</i> is "freedom always has a price."  <span style="color:blue">First, establish the extent to which you are free in your life.  Then, draw on at least two texts to comment on the price of that freedom.</span>  Possible things to think about to keep the ideas flowing include:
											<ul>
												<li>
													Do you agree with the characterizations these texts of the price? 
												</li>
												<li>
													Is it worth it in your view?
												</li>
												<li>
													How could we preserve freedoms without such a steep price?
												</li>
											</ul>
											 
										</p>


										<h3><a name = "office">A CIE Character Runs for Office</a></h3>
										<p>
											<b>NOTE:</b> The extremely cool and creative essay idea below was by student Alex Kolb in <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/1701-david-aipperspach">Professor Aipperspach's</a> CIE class this fall!
										</p>

										<p>
											Choose a "character" (inclusive of authors or person in a text) from one of the texts that we have read in CIE to run for president in the 2024 election. Consider how this person would lead the country. <span style="color:blue">What values do they have?  What personal qualities would they bring?  How would their decisions affect the nation - positively or negatively? Would their leadership be beneficial, harmful, or a mix of both? Use citations and specific references to CIE texts to support your claim.</span> 
										</p>
