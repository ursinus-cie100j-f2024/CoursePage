CLASS TODO:

JAM BOARD: What's wrong with slavery?
Is this something unique to slavery?
Also against wage labor
Can't tell


DISCUSSION: 
Frederick Douglass was obviously an incredibly brilliant, courageous, and tenacious person.  But there were likely other brilliant, courageous, and tenacious people who were not able to reach his stage as an abolitionist.  What key moments of luck did he experience that enabled him to, against all odds, become educated and escape slavery?


DISCUSSION:
* Douglass mentions that the institution of slavery is corrosive for both slaves and slave owners.  Do you agree with this?  What examples can you think of from the book?
- Sophia Ault, etc


FREE WRITING:
* How was keeping slaves in mental darkness key to preventing insurrections?  What devices of mental darkness are imposed upon us today?  What would it take to abolish them?


OTHER DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
* How does religion shape the events in Douglass's life?
* Douglass says what he experienced as a slave was fairly typical, and even better in some cases.  Does this surprise you?
