Why is slavery bad exercise

"I used to be a slave," Lincoln said in an early speech; in fact, "we were all slaves one time or another."
[Reflect on this in the wage labor discussion]
[point out that we should be careful, like people making analogies between wearing masks and the Holacoust]


Discussion Question: 
Do you consider Lincoln a good man?  Do you consider Lincoln a good man for his time?  Did the details in this passage have any impact on your opinion?
Do you think you would have done things differently from Lincoln had you lived in his time?
Do you think you would have renounced slavery if you'd been a slave owner?
